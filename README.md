# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)
[2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I'm attempting to solve each day's puzzles in as many languages as possible,
but the primary language I'm using is C#.

Input files for each day are in the `inputs` directory.

Each language's solutions are organized into their own directory:

- C# - `./cs/`
- Powershell - `./ps/`
- Python - `./py/`
- Rust - `./rs/`
- Bash - `./sh/`

Ideas for other languages to do:

- Angular - `./ng/`
- C - `./c/`
- C++ - `./cpp/`
- Emacs Lisp - `./el/`
- Go - `./go/`
- Haskell - `./hs/`
- Java - `./java/`
- JavaScript - `./js/`
- Lua - `./lua/`
- Ruby - `./rb/`
- Scheme - `./ss/`
- SQL - `./sql/`
